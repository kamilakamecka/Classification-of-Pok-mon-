# Classification-of-Pok-mone
 - in progress  
The goal of the project is to create an AI model for classifying Pokémon in images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning in PyTorch. The model is expected to achieve high accuracy and return a link to PokeWiki when certainty is above 70%, and a list of similar Pokémon when certainty is lower.
